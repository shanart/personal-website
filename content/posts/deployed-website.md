Today I just deployed this static website on my server. It feels lightweight and easy. You do not need to care about some backend and database like with 
Wordpress. You just upload your static html/css files on `public_html` and forget about it :) Now I want to setup search and categories.

Don't be fooled by seeming simplicity of Hugo static site generator. Just see this [docs](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) ! Hugo have a search, tags, advance template system and many other things... It's very powerfull mechanism to create simple static websites, blogs, etc.
